By being a central base we can help coordinate supply of food to as many foodbanks as possible e.g. we can store large lorry load palettes of food from bigger donors e.g. to feed 15,000 with pasta centrally.  Each food bank could then come to us weekly to stock up on what they needed and trade between them using our logistics knowledge (learnt from 5 years of supplying to warehouses across Greece). 2) We are also equipped with all non-food items needed to survive a more severe economic depression e.g. blankets, bedding, candles, clothing boxed by age/season/ gender- we see this need coming within a few months as desititution/domestic/child abuse increases and could be provider to others of essential non-food items e.g. maybe via foodbanks or other dedicated charities e.g. elderly  ",
